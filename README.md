### Previously project-arrakis

Python based particle tracking algorithms for CFD data

A highly parallelized set of Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT) algorithms based on Python to post-process steady and unsteady CFD data. An advanced programming interface (API) is developed for uncertainty quantification of optical velocimetry data.

# Installation:
Run the following command in the terminal to install the package:
```pip install lptlib```
